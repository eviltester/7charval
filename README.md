A simple exploratory testing exercise

When I release this to the web I usually only release the html file and the obfuscated javascript.

I sometimes upload and amend the .htaccess file to ensure that the users can't access the folder structure.

When written it didn't work on IE but did on Firefox to create a cross browser defect as well as the defects coded into the script.
